# graft — High-Performance Open-Source Graph Database

## Project Overview

graft is an open-source graph database written in Rust, designed to be the world's best graph database. It uses a hardware-aware, OS-integrated architecture that no existing graph database employs.

## Key Differentiators

1. **Shard-per-core, shared-nothing concurrency** (Seastar/ScyllaDB model in Rust) — one OS thread per CPU core, each owning its own data partition. No locks, no shared mutable state in the hot path.
2. **Native graph storage with index-free adjacency** — 64-byte fixed-size node/edge records with direct pointers to neighbors. O(1) per traversal hop, independent of total graph size.
3. **GQL-native query language** (ISO/IEC 39075:2024) — the first ISO database language since SQL. Not Cypher, not Gremlin, not a proprietary language.
4. **Custom memory allocators** — slab allocators for topology (O(1), zero fragmentation), arena allocators for query execution (cache-friendly, O(1) bulk deallocation).
5. **Kernel-bypass I/O** — io_uring for storage, with path toward SPDK/DPDK for full OS bypass.
6. **AGPL v3 license, no feature gating** — one codebase, one license. No crippled community edition.

### Storage Format
- **8KB pages** aligned to NVMe page size
- **Node records**: 64 bytes (one cache line) — node_id, label, first_out_edge, first_in_edge (linked list heads for index-free adjacency), inline properties, MVCC tx_min
- **Edge records**: 64 bytes — edge_id, source, target, next_out_edge, next_in_edge (doubly-linked for bidirectional traversal), inline properties
- **127 records per page** (8160 usable bytes / 64 bytes)
- **Properties**: inline-first (8-16 bytes on record), overflow to property pages for larger values
- **Buffer pool**: per-shard, CLOCK eviction, O_DIRECT

### Concurrency Model
- One OS thread pinned to one CPU core, owning one shard
- Node ID upper 8 bits = shard assignment (supports 256 cores)
- Edges owned by source node's shard
- Inter-shard communication via SPSC lock-free ring buffers (cache-line padded, power-of-two capacity)
- `ShardMessage` protocol for inter-shard request/response (ScanNodes, GetNode, GetNodeProperty, GetOutboundEdges, GetInboundEdges + their responses)
- Custom cooperative event loop (no tokio on server): `poll_coordinator → poll_io → poll_messages → advance_queries → submit_io`
- `build_shard_mesh()` creates a fully-interconnected topology of `ShardEventLoop` instances
- Multi-shard `Database` with `StorageAccess` routing: round-robin node creation, NodeId-based shard routing, cross-shard scan fan-out
- `ShardCluster`: production-path thread-per-shard executor — spawns N `ShardEventLoop` instances on OS threads, coordinator routes queries via SPSC queues with fan-out for scans and targeted routing for point lookups
- Adaptive idle strategy: spin for 64 iterations then `thread::yield_now()`
- Core pinning: optional `pin_to_core()` via `sched_setaffinity` (Linux) / `thread_policy_set` (macOS)
- Single shared atomic: global commit counter (AtomicU64)

### Transaction Model
- MVCC with per-shard `TransactionManager` tracking active/committed transactions
- Auto-commit: every query is implicitly wrapped in a transaction (begin before, commit/abort after)
- `Snapshot` visibility: checks `tx_min`/`tx_max` against snapshot timestamp and active set
- Own-writes visible within a transaction (special case in `is_record_visible`)
- `was_committed()` handles both current-session and post-recovery (pre-`base_tx_id`) visibility
- Per-shard WAL files with 64KB write buffer; WAL records stamped with `current_tx`; group commit (write to OS page cache on commit, fsync every 2ms or 64 commits)
- Two-pass WAL recovery: pass 1 builds committed tx set, pass 2 replays only committed writes
- Snapshot isolation with first-committer-wins conflict detection: `Shard::log_page_write()` (the choke point every node/edge/prop record write funnels through) records each write in the tx's write set via `TransactionManager::record_write()`; the conflict key is `(page_type, page_id, slot)` because node/edge/prop files have independent page-id namespaces (label writes deliberately not recorded — idempotent dictionary inserts on a synthetic key); recovery replay and replica apply bypass `log_page_write`, so they never record write sets
- Edge chain traversal reads raw records for next pointers, checks visibility separately (invisible edges skipped without breaking chain)
- `StorageAccess` trait has `begin_tx/commit_tx/abort_tx` (default no-ops for backward compat); `commit_tx` returns `Result<(), String>` — a failed commit (e.g. `WriteConflict`) surfaces through executor auto-commit (`ExecutionError::CommitFailed`), `Response::CommitResult`, `ShardCluster::commit_explicit_tx`, and the server's COMMIT_TX handler as a wire ERROR
- `ShardCluster` generates global tx_id via `AtomicU64`, routes `BeginTx/CommitTx/AbortTx` to all shard workers
- Concurrent explicit transactions: coordinator methods are tx_id-parameterized (`query_in_tx(tx_id, gql)`, `commit_explicit_tx(tx_id)`, `abort_explicit_tx(tx_id)`) — N transactions can be concurrently active (per-shard `TransactionManager` tracks them; `SetActiveTx` restores context per statement); the cluster's `current_tx`/`in_explicit_tx` are transient per-call executor context, never persistent connection state; auto-commit queries always allocate their own tx (never join an open explicit tx). Known gap (todo.md Milestone 4): no cross-shard prepare phase yet — a multi-shard conflicting tx commits on non-conflicting shards while the client gets the error
- Explicit `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` over wire protocol with per-connection tx state (server passes the connection's tx_id into the cluster API), orphaned tx abort on disconnect passes that tx_id

### Query Engine
- LALRPOP parser (LR(1), build-time codegen) with hand-written lexer
- Pipeline: GQL text → AST → Logical Plan → Physical Plan → Push-based execution
- Phase 1 GQL subset:
  - **Clauses**: MATCH, CREATE, WHERE, RETURN (with DISTINCT), ORDER BY, LIMIT, SKIP, SET, DELETE
  - **Expressions**: arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`), comparison (`=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`)
  - **Null handling**: `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL`
  - **String predicates**: `CONTAINS`, `STARTS WITH`, `ENDS WITH`
  - **Aggregations**: `COUNT(*)`, `COUNT(expr)`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`
  - **Scalar functions**: `id()`, `type()`, `labels()`, `toString()`, `toInteger()`, `toFloat()`
  - **Variable-length paths**: `*`, `*N`, `*N..M`, `*N..`, `*..M` (BFS with cycle detection)

### I/O Layer
- `IoBackend: Send` trait with swappable implementations, `default_backend()` auto-selects best platform backend
- `IoUringBackend` (Linux production): O_DIRECT for data files (bypasses kernel page cache), fdatasync for direct files, pread/pwrite fallback for WAL (small sequential writes), EINVAL fallback for filesystems without O_DIRECT (e.g. tmpfs), batched `write_pages_batch`/`sync_batch` for multi-SQE submission
- `PosixIoBackend` (macOS dev), `SimIoBackend` (testing)
- `Shard::open_with_io()` accepts `Box<dyn IoBackend + Send>` for caller-provided backends
- All non-determinism behind injectable interfaces (I/O, time, RNG) for simulation testing

### Replication Architecture
- **WAL-shipping**: primary captures WAL records during mutations → `CommitBuffer` holds per-tx → committed records shipped as `WalBatchMsg` → replica deserializes and applies via `apply_wal_record()`
- **Data flow (primary)**: `Shard.repl_log` (mutation capture) → `poll_replication()` drains → `ReplicationSender.on_wal_record()` → `CommitBuffer` (per-tx buffering, release on commit, discard on abort) → `sender.poll()` → `WalBatchMsg` batches → `SharedQueue<WalBatchMsg>` outbox → network writer thread → TCP to replica
- **Data flow (replica)**: TCP from primary → network reader thread → `SharedQueue<WalBatchMsg>` inbox → `poll_replication()` drains → `ReplicationReceiver.on_batch()` (CRC-verified deserialization) → `drain_records()` → `shard.apply_wal_record()` → `WalAckMsg` → `SharedQueue<WalAckMsg>` ack_outbox → network writer thread → TCP to primary
- **Thread model**: shard event loop threads never do network I/O; `SharedQueue<T>` (`Arc<Mutex<VecDeque>>`) bridges shard threads ↔ network I/O threads
- **Cluster constructors**: `ShardCluster::new_primary()`/`new_replica()`/`open_primary()`/`open_replica()` return `(Self, ReplHandles)` with per-shard `SharedQueue` handles; standalone constructors unchanged
- **MVCC on replicas**: `apply_wal_record()` calls `tx_mgr.advance_past()` to mark replicated tx_ids as committed; `sync_tx_counter()` (via `GetNextTxId` request) ensures cluster-level tx counter stays above replicated data so new query snapshots see all replicated records
- **Network transport**: single TCP connection per replica, multiplexed by `shard_id` in messages; `run_primary_listener()` accepts connections on replication port (7688), spawns writer+reader threads per replica; `run_replica_connector()` connects with exponential backoff (1s→30s)
- **Dynamic registration**: `ReplControl::Register`/`Unregister` messages via `SharedQueue` allow network threads to register replicas on shard event loops without locking

### Wire Protocol
- Custom binary: 8-byte header (magic 0xGF01, version, msg type, length) + MessagePack payload
- Port 7687
- Message types: HELLO, QUERY, RESULT, ROW, SUMMARY, ERROR, BEGIN_TX, COMMIT_TX, ROLLBACK_TX

17. ~~Replication (Phases 8a-8e)~~ — **done**: `graft-repl` crate with replication protocol (ReplHello/WalBatch/WalAck/ReplStatus), CommitBuffer (per-tx WAL record buffering, release on commit, discard on abort), ReplicationSender (ships committed records, tracks per-replica ACK'd LSN), ReplicationReceiver (CRC-verified WAL batch deserialization and apply), WalRetention (retention window tracking based on min ACK'd LSN). Event loop `poll_replication()` phase (primary: drain committed WAL → outbound batches; replica: apply pending records). Server `--role` (standalone/primary/replica), `--primary`, `--replication-port` (7688), `--metrics-port` (9100) flags. Admin commands (`SHOW REPLICAS`, `SHOW REPLICATION STATUS`, `SHOW REPLICATION LAG`, `SHOW SHARD STATUS`, `PROMOTE REPLICA`). Write rejection on read-only replicas. HelloMsg extended with optional role/read_only/shards fields (backward-compatible). Client exposes `server_role()`/`is_read_only()`/`server_shards()`. CLI shows role in banner, backslash shortcuts (`\status`, `\replicas`, `\lag`, `\shards`). Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint with `graft_role` and `graft_shard_count` gauges, `/health` check. 266 tests passing.
18. ~~Replication network transport (Phase 8f-transport)~~ — **done**: End-to-end WAL shipping over TCP. `SharedQueue<T>` (thread-safe `Arc<Mutex<VecDeque>>`) for shard↔network thread communication. `ReplControl` enum for dynamic replica registration. Shard WAL record capture (`repl_enabled`, `repl_log`, `repl_next_lsn`) in 5 mutation paths (begin, page_write, label_write, commit, abort). Event loop `poll_replication()` rewritten: primary path drains repl_log → sender → outbox SharedQueue, processes ACKs from ack_inbox, handles ReplControl messages; replica path drains inbox → receiver → apply_wal_record, pushes ACKs to ack_outbox. `ShardCluster::new_primary/new_replica/open_primary/open_replica` constructors return `(Self, ReplHandles)` with per-shard SharedQueues. `ShardReplQueues`/`ReplHandles` types exported. `graft-server/src/replication.rs`: `run_primary_listener` (TCP accept, ReplHello handshake, per-replica writer/reader threads), `run_replica_connector` (connect with exponential backoff, reader/ack-writer threads). Server main.rs wired: role-aware cluster creation, replication thread launch. 278 tests passing. (Note: the tx-counter-sync mechanism described here at the time — `sync_tx_counter` via `GetNextTxId` — was found unsound by code review and replaced; see step 18a.)
18a. ~~Phase 8f transport hardening (code review fixes, all 3 milestones)~~ — **done**: multi-agent code review found 15 confirmed bugs in the transport built in step 18 (`tasks/code-review-findings.md`, full fix design/rationale in `tasks/todo.md`). Milestone 1 (9 findings) fixed network-transport/delivery-reliability: `ReplicaOutboxRegistry` (per-shard `Arc<Mutex<HashMap<replica_id, SharedQueue<WalBatchMsg>>>>`) replaces the single shared outbox that used to be drained racily by every replica connection — now each replica gets its own queue, fanned out to by `ReplicationSender::poll()`, capped at 1GB/replica with eviction beyond that. Writer threads use peek-front/pop-front instead of destructive `drain()` so a send error doesn't lose the batch. `ReplHelloMsg` restructured with a stable `replica_id` and a `cluster_id` the primary generates/persists and rejects mismatches on (`graft-server/src/identity.rs`), plus `shard_count` negotiation. Accept loop no longer blocks on the handshake. Replica has a 5s read timeout + shared stop-flag so a dead primary is detected and reconnected to. Milestone 2 (2 findings) fixed LSN persistence and corrupted-batch handling: `Shard::next_repl_lsn()` persists a reservation-ceiling (`REPL_LSN_RESERVE_BATCH = 10_000`) to `<shard_dir>/repl_lsn.meta` so a primary restart never reissues an already-shipped LSN; `ReplicationReceiver` gets a `poisoned` state that halts forward progress (rather than silently bridging the gap) on a CRC/truncation error. Milestone 3 (4 findings) fixed replica MVCC/tx-counter correctness: `ShardCluster::new_replica`/`open_replica` now seed `next_tx_id` from `REPLICA_TX_ID_BASE = 1 << 63` — a disjoint range from real (primary-issued/replicated) tx_ids, reserved by construction rather than by racy synchronization (same "reserve bits for a purpose" pattern as NodeId's shard encoding) — which deletes the unsound `sync_tx_counter()`/`GetNextTxId` mechanism entirely rather than patching it; `Shard::commit_current_tx()` now ships a replication Abort (not Commit) when `tx_mgr.commit()` reports a `WriteConflict`. 306 tests passing, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean, `cargo fmt --check` clean.
19. **Next**: semi-sync/sync replication (Phase 8f-durability), snapshot shipping (Phase 8g), automatic failover (Phase 8h)

## Design Principles

- **No locks in the hot path** — shard-per-core eliminates contention
- **No GC** — Rust ownership + custom allocators give deterministic latency
- **Simulation-testable** — all non-determinism behind injectable interfaces from day one
- **Standards-first** — GQL, not a proprietary query language
- **Truly open source** — AGPL v3, every feature in one codebase
- **Reliability over convenience** — when choosing between implementation approaches, always choose the option that is more reliable under worst-case scenarios (crashes, corruption, partial writes), even if it requires more upfront work. No shortcuts that create separate failure modes or custom formats when a uniform mechanism exists.
- **Scale beyond competitors** — every design decision must consider what happens at 1B+ nodes and edges. If an approach requires all data of a certain type to fit in memory, or creates an O(n) bottleneck that competitors don't have, it's the wrong approach. Design for larger-than-competitor scale from the start.
